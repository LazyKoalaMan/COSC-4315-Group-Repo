# COSC-4315-Group-Repo
A repository meant to manage and share files for COSC4315 25418 - Programming Languages and Paradigms

1) Taking in the program and figuring out which is a function, like the interpreter finds def to find functions up until a indention. So this would also need a indent reader.
2) Input reader of input, which would execute the files and prints the stuff. Which is the easier part to do

# requirements
Output lists should be sorted, comparing strings. Treat numbers as strings.

# Do Nots
You cannot existing Python libraries with advanced arrays, dictionary or hash tables data struc-
tures. Therefore, you cannot their associated functions either. Why? They defeat a functional
programming approach.
